# Different types of Yoga
[types of yoga](https://youtu.be/iZTXTzc8Gj8?si=3a-BGP-hfFQ4W8U3)
## Hatha
Hatha yoga is the stam/original yoga. The other yoga type branched of from it.
Spend a few breaths in one pose.
Good for beginners because it’s slower
## Vinyasa
Flow yoga. You flow from pose to pose.

## Ashtanga
Like Vinyasa but there is only one sequence. This sequence has a few difficulty levels.
## Iyengar
Slow, strikt, with tools to assist you. Good for beginners or injured people.
## Hot
Hatha or Vinyasa yoga but in a hot room(30-40°C)

## Bikram
Like Iyengar but in a 40°C room.
Very challenging.
## Yin
Slow, relaxing, hold poses for a long time, easy.
