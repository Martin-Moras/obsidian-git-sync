1. **Neurobiology:**
    
    - The brain is the central organ responsible for most cognitive functions. It consists of billions of neurons (nerve cells) that communicate with each other through electrochemical signals.
    - Different regions of the brain are associated with specific functions. For example, the prefrontal cortex is linked to decision-making and personality, while the hippocampus is crucial for memory.
2. **Neural Networks:**
    
    - Neural networks are intricate networks of interconnected neurons that work together to process information. These networks are crucial for various cognitive functions, including learning, memory, and problem-solving.
