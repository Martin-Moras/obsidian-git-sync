### [[Toe]] 
I have an idea for a [[Toe]]. There are:
- 3 Space dimensions
- 1 Time dimension
- 1 Decision dimmension
![[2024-01-13 2024-01-14 13.22.47.excalidraw|200]]
if a particle makes the decision to travel through the decision dimension, it accelerates in one direction. 
1. case: particle doesn't change its position on the decision dimension
	- it keeps its velocity
2.  case: particle changes its position on the decision dimension in the **positive** directon
	- it accelerates in the positive direction in the space dimension
3.  case: particle changes its position on the decision dimension in the **negative** directon
	- it accelerates in the positive direction in the space dimension
