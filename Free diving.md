# Hold breath
## What you train
### CO2 tolerance 
Time to train: Days to weeks

 CO2 gives us the urge to breathe
### Deal with low oxygen levels (Hypoxic threshold)
Time to train: Weeks to Months to years
### Mammalian dive reflex
- gets trained each time you hold your breath 
### Aerobic Processes
#### Use lactic acid as a fuel source 

# Training 
## Static breath hold
| Set | Hold | Breath | Interval |
| --- | ---- | ------ | -------- |
| 1   | 2:00 | 2:00   | 4        |
| 2   | 3:00 | 1:00   | 4        |
| 3   | 3:00 | 1:00   | 4        |
| 4   | 3:00 | 1:00   | 4        |
| 5   | 3:00 | 1:00   | 4        |
| 6   | 3:00 | 1:00   | 4        |
| 7   | 3:00 | 1:00   | 4        |
| 8   | 3:00 | 1:00   | 4        |
E.g. set 1: hold for 2 min breathe for 2 min(Interval=2+2=4)
If your able to do this table increase interval to 5 min.
**Benefits**: 
 1. makes you comfortable with involuntary contractions 
 2. Deeper levels of relaxation 
 3. gain body control 
 4. experience high levels of CO2
 5. Mammalian dive
