7:00 woke up but was half sleeping
7:30 mom started car -> I stood up
7:30 - 8:54 toilet -> shower -> rice, cauliflower breakfast -> ==Meditate== -> Refill water dispenser
After 15 min my mind was very empty. There wasn't much in my [[Working memory]] either. I could very clearly see which thoughts where in my mind and what thoughts they brought with them. I could choose very consciously which thoughts I wanted and which I don't wanted to think. My mind felt like an empty room and I could very clearly see the thoughts that were in that room the the ones that wanted to come in to it.
