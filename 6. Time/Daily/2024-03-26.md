7:00 woke up but was half sleeping
7:30 mom started car -> I stood up
7:30 - 8:54 toilet -> shower -> rice, cauliflower breakfast -> ==Meditate== -> Refill water dispenser
After 15 min my mind was very empty. There wasn't much in my [[Working memory]] either. I could very clearly see which thoughts where in my mind and what thoughts they brought with them. I could choose very consciously which thoughts I wanted and which I don't wanted to think. My mind felt like an empty room and I could very clearly see the thoughts that were in that room the the ones that wanted to come in to it.

17:00 - 18:11 ==right after my Yoga session I kept laying on the floor. I started visualizing me having sex with a woman in my parents room. Than we showered together. **Beautiful**.
After that I focused on my bodily sensations -> thought of nothing and noticed how I had almost fallen asleep. It felt like I, awareness, fell from the back of my head. But I rose up quickly again.
Now I feel very meditative.
Ideas I had:
1. Stop ripping of fingernails
2. Lucid dream
3. Turn clock to: every hour beep. To question if Iâ€˜m awake
4. Make every moment as beautiful as possible
