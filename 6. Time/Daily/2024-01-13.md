### [[Toe]]
I have an idea for a [[Toe]]. There are:
- 3 Space dimensions
- 1 Time dimension
- 1 Decision dimmension
![[3D axe.excalidraw|200]]
if a particle makes the decision to travel through the **decision** dimension, it accelerates in one direction. 
1. case: particle doesn't change its position on the decision dimension
	- it keeps its velocity
2.  case: particle changes its position on the decision dimension in the **positive** direction
	- it accelerates in the **positive** direction in the space dimension
3.  case: particle changes its position on the decision dimension in the **negative** direction
	- it accelerates the **negative** direction in the space dimension

For every space **dimension** there is a **decision** dimension.
#### Forces
1. Strong 
2. Weak
3. Magnetic
Forces interact between particles. At lest in the space dimension. For the other dimensions I'm not sure. This is, so reality doesn't become a weird mess. 
#### Gravity 
"Energy flows where attention goes"
![[Pasted image 20240114162002.png|200]]
Attention bends reality and attracts all particles in the **space** and **choice** dimension.
#### Brain
The brain is a very influenceable system. It does what we focus our attention on.
