Yesterday and today I was mostly wasting time on YouTube. Though today I started to become very aware again and I learned some things:
1. being aware of a resistance part weakens its power over me
2. I‘m so grateful of everything I have
3. Hyrachical mechanistic mind (hmm)
4. Hypothesis: just be aware of unwanted parts, don‘t act on them
