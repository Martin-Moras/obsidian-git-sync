# Dreams
## 1. 14:00 -17:00 
I work on a big farm area
Two man came in a truck with two trailers 
I followed them 
we had some thing to hide and they did too
I asked why they had two trailers 
they said they always do (lie)
I lead them around while my colleges just stood there 
they had covered the farming buildings with a banner which said: "Laboratory"
we came to a ==Scheune== and watched... something:
many 14 Year old girls and one 14 year old boy poped up in the ==Scheune== one after the other. the boy smiled 
woke up.
