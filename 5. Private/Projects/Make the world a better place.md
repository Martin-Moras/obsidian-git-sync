To make the world a better place, one must first see the problems our world has. Because if every problem is fixed, the world would be already a way better place. For some that might be enough, but not for me. I want to improve myself and the world.

# Problems 
- [[climate change]]
- [[reckless people]]

# Approaches
I rephrased my ultimate goal: "Make the world a more beautiful place." of course there are multiple aspects to beautifulness:
1. Visual aspect
2. Mental aspect
3. Nature aspect (Climate, animal welfare)
4. Development aspect (technological development, medical development, science development)
