## I must be smarter than Hagen
Hagen said that holding your breath helps against higups. I emedietly denied it. Later I thought about it and realized that he was right and I was wrong. I inquired into the part that denied Hagens suggestion.
Why did you not take Hagens suggestion?
Because than I‘d have to acknowledge that he‘s smarter than me.
Why is that bad?
Because I‘m older than him and I must be smarter than him.
Why do you have to be smarter than him?

(Now I don‘t remember it anymore)

## Phone/iPad away when parent comes in.
Why did you put your iPad away?
Because I’m not allowed to be on my iPad/phone. ‚Memories of me in my bed late at night hiding my phone from my parents.
Why do you think that?
‚same Memories.
But this was just because they don‘t want me to be on my phone the whole time. ‚I said a few more reasons‘.
HEALED (I hope) (nope)
