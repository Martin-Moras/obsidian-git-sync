Hagen said that holding your breath helps against higups. I emedietly denied it. Later I thought about it and realized that he was right and I was wrong. I inquired into the part that denied Hagens suggestion.
Why did you not take Hagens suggestion?
Because than I‘d have to acknowledge that he‘s smarter than me.
Why is that bad?
Because I‘m older than him and I must be smarter than him.
Why do you have to be smarter than him
