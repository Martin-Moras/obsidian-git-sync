# Text
## Intro
**Everything is a fractal node**. Everything can be defined as an **object**. Every object is made out of **more tiny objects** which each **interact** with each other. And every one of these objects is made out of more objects. And you can subdivide objects on and on until you can't anymore. Here you come to the **core objects**. Some have their own rules, properties and states, others share theirs. 
Or do they. Maybe, core objects all have the same rules. Like in the [[String theory]]. Or maybe in not all systems all core objects have the same rules, but in the best systems that's the case.
## The potential
The fractal verse is a way of understanding our world. A frame work which not only helps us to understand the world but a framework which we can use to re imagine our world. We can also use this frame work to create our tools. Like:
- Language
- Math
- Way of writing and taking notes 
-  Computer programs
-  Internet
## Realisation
And that's exactly what I did. (explain my fn project concepts)
# Nodes
## Core nodes
 

# Fractal node projects 
[[Fractal node language]]
[[Fractal node mind]]
[[Fractal node math]]
## To Code

[[Fractal node notes]]
[[Fractal node web]]
[[Fractal node chat]]
[[Fractal node code]]
[[Fractal node OS]]
[[Fractal node Ai]]
[[Fractal mind game]]
[[Fractal node files]]
Figure out which apps that are commonly used I can remake in the fn verse style.
# Theories
## The more nodes someone knows the more intelligent he is
In [[Fractal node web]], [[Fractal node math]], [[Fractal node code]] there will be some core nodes that everyone will know. If you connect that now to [[Intelligence]], than you can define ones [[Intelligence]] by how many nodes one knows and **can work with**.
### What supports this theory
The more nodes about [economics](BwL) I know, the more intelligent I am about economics.


create new nodes based on the ones you already know
