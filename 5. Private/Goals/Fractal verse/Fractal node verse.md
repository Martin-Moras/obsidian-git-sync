**Everything is a fractal node**. Everything can be defined as an **object**. Every object is made out of **more tiny objects** which each **interact** with each other. And every one of these objects is made out of more objects. And you can subdivide objects on and on until you can't anymore. Here you come to the **core objects**. Some have their own rules, properties and states, others share theirs. 
Or do they. Maybe, core objects all have the same rules. Like in the [[String theory]]. Or maybe in not all systems all core objects have the same rules, but in the best systems that's the case.

# Theories
## The more nodes someone knows the more intelligent he is
In [[Fractal node web]], [[Fractal node math]], [[Fractal node code]] there will be some core nodes that everyone will know. If you connect that now to [[Intelligence]], than you can define ones [[Intelligence]] by how many nodes one knows and **can work with**.
### What supports this theory
The more nodes about [economics](BwL) I know, the more intelligent I am about economics.
