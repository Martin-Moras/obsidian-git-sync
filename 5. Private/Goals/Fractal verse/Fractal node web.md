## Organisation
### Search engine
find out how a search engine works (google) and see how it could be implemented.
### Groups
A collared, semi transparent background which is behind nodes of one topic. e.g. coding related nodes: blue background, Biology related nodes: green background.
- arrange nodes so that the more general nodes are lighter and the less general nodes are darker
- arrange nodes roughly on a collar wheel 
#### General nodes
how general is a node
factors:
- how many nodes are based on that node
- if it applies to a specific case or if it is a concept that can be applied to a wide variety of situations
### Dimensions
- adding a third spacial dimension can also simplify ordering and filtering nodes and topics
- adding a **time** dimension to it can also simplify ordering and filtering nodes and topics
- maybe there isn't a fixed amount of dimensions and one can just a position on a dimensional axe
Possible dimensions:
- 2, 3 spacial on the web
- 2, 3 spacial in real life (would be helpful for historic events and news articles and astronomy)
- 1 time added to the web
- 1 time happened in real life (would be helpful for historic events and news articles)
