# Teaching concepts
# Model first vs Example first

**Q**: Hi! I want to become a better teacher and I was wondering if it is better to first teach the model/function and give than examples or the other way around? 
Example 1: 
- first I teach: the "+" sign adds the number on its right and the number on its left together. 
- and than I teach: For example 1+1=2 and 3+5=8 and 7+19=26 
Example 2: 
- first I teach: For example 1+1=2 and 3+5=8 and 7+19=26 
- and than I teach: the "+" sign adds the number on its right and the number on its left together.


**A**: There isn't a single "better" way, as both approaches have their merits and drawbacks depending on the specific concept you're teaching, the age and learning style of your students, and your overall teaching goals. Here's a breakdown of each approach to help you decide which might be more effective in different situations:

**Starting with the model/function (Example 1):**

- **Pros:**
    - Provides a clear and concise definition upfront, which can be helpful for learners who prefer a structured approach.
    - Establishes the underlying concept before delving into specific examples, potentially aiding in generalization and transfer of knowledge to new situations.
- **Cons:**
    - May introduce abstract concepts that learners might find challenging to grasp without concrete examples, potentially leading to confusion.
    - Learners might struggle to connect the abstract concept to real-world applications without initial grounding in practical examples.

**Starting with examples (Example 2):**

- **Pros:**
    - Leverages concrete examples to make the concept more relatable and engaging for learners, especially those who benefit from a more hands-on approach.
    - Provides a foundation of practical experience before introducing the formal definition, potentially fostering a deeper understanding of the underlying concept.
- **Cons:**
    - Learners might struggle to extract the general rule or model from the specific examples, potentially hindering their ability to apply the concept to new situations.
    - The lack of upfront explanation might leave learners with a fragmented understanding, especially if they don't readily grasp the underlying connection between the examples.

Here are some additional factors to consider when choosing the best approach:

- **The complexity of the concept:** Simpler concepts might be easier to grasp with examples first, while more complex concepts might benefit from an initial explanation.
- **The age and learning style of your students:** Younger learners or those who prefer a more visual approach might benefit from examples first, while older learners or those who favor a more theoretical approach might do better with the model/function first.
- **Your overall teaching goals:** If you want students to be able to apply the concept to new situations, starting with the model/function might be better. If your goal is for them to understand the basic idea, starting with examples might be more effective.

Ultimately, the best approach is likely a combination of both methods. You can start with an engaging example or two to capture students' attention and pique their curiosity, then introduce the model/function to provide a clear framework. Throughout your teaching, revisit and connect the examples back to the general concept to solidify understanding and encourage application.
