The meaning of live is for every person different. For some it is helping other people, for others it is liveing a happy live, but for me it is development. I want to develop myself, working on my nolage on my skills, and on my health. 
The reason why humans are on top of the evolutionary ledder is because we had the ability to make and use tools. With tools we were able to get the work we needed to do faster done and then we had more time to work on the things we wanted to do. That's why we have so many things now a days, like computers, chocolate and the internet. We were able to create more and more things. We learned to grow crops, we learned to make music and we learned to create tools.
That's why the meaning of live is for me, development.
