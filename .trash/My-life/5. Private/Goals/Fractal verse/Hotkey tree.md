![[Hotkey tree 2024-04-23 21.20.20.excalidraw]]
When you use a app, you have a little window that displays the shortcuts (hotkeys) you can use. When you click on a shortcut with your mouse (or press \<help Shortcut\>) the shortcut will be explained to you.
This should be used for:
- [[Fractal node code]]
- [[Fractal node web]]
- [[Fractal node OS]]

# \<help shortcut\>
When you press the \<help shortcut\> followed by a shortcut that is visible on your [[Hotkey tree]], the shortcut will be explained to you.
